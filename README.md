# freeModbus

This repository is build from all the history versions released at [FreeModbus project on SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freemodbus.berlios/files/)<br />
It's a freemodbus library for embedded systems (http://freemodbus.org/), that was originally written by Christian Walter wolti@sil.at.

And I've fix all bugs that I've found.

Later it'll be tagged as v1.6.0 for release after all of source codes had been reviewed and tested.
